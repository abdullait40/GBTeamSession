# ðŸš€ Project Collaboration Guidelines

Welcome to the project repository!  
Please read the following instructions carefully before starting your contributions.

## ðŸ“„ Branching Rules

- Each collaborator will work on a **separate branch**.
- The branch name should be **your own name** (e.g., `john`, `emma`, `alex`).
- **All commits** must be pushed to **your own branch**.
- **Do NOT commit directly** to the `main` (or `master`) branch.

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Create and switch to your branch
git checkout -b your-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

# Push your branch
git push origin your-name
